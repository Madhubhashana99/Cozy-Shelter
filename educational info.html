                      <u> The Best Dog Treats For Your Dog</u><br><br>
                      Now that we’ve covered some dog treats to avoid, let’s talk about the alternatives—the treats you can give your dog that will keep them happy and healthy.<br><br>
                      When shopping for dog treats, you should look for treats that are:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Grain-free</li>
                        <li>Full of nutritional value</li>
                        <li>Made from high-quality ingredients</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      So what, exactly, are the best treats to give your pup?<br><br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Soft-Baked Treats are a great option. Soft-baked treats (like Winner Winner Chicken Dinner) are a little easier on your pup’s chompers—but still have all the nutritional benefits (and yumminess!) you’d want in a treat.</li><br>
                        <li>If your dog is head over paws for flavorful treats, Crunchy Biscuit Treats are a great option. Crunchy Biscuit Treats have everything your dog could want in a treat. They’re packed with both flavor and nutrition and are free from any of the “nasties” (like wheat, corn, and soy) you want to avoid when choosing dog treats.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      Avoid the treat aisle altogether and find plenty of nutritious choices already on hand in your kitchen. Because obesity can be a huge issue for dogs,  stick with fruits and vegetables. Recommended items are apples, bananas, carrots, cucumbers, watermelon, pure pumpkin purée, and peppers. These items should be sliced, and remove all the seeds before serving your dog. <br><br>
                      A list of approved low-calorie human foods also includes blueberries, Cheerios, small pieces of cheese, lean proteins like chicken and beef, and even ice cubes. “You can also use common human foods you might already have in your fridge — just remember to break them into very small pieces.”

                      <u> Before the Celebrations </u><br><br>
                      If there are any upcoming celebrations that would traditionally include fireworks, pet safety preparations can be made in the days or hours before the revelries begin.<br><br>
                      When shopping for dog treats, you should look for treats that are:
                      <ol>

                        <li>
                          <b>Give your pet lots of exercise.</b><br>
                          Walk your dog during the day, especially on the day of the festivities. If he’s happily tired from exercise and play, it would make him calmer and less frightened of the loud noises that would come later. Do the same with your pet cats. Play with your kitties for a while longer than usual and hopefully, they’d be tired enough to sleep through the noise.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Create a safe space for your pet.</b><br>
                          Days before the holiday, you can prepare a room or a crate inside the house where your pet can safely hide when he gets a little scared. Create a space in some cozy corner, with extra beddings under which he can burrow in. You can even prepare a soundproof kennel using household materials. Include all his favorite toys and treats in the safe space.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Ask your vet for medication, if needed.</b><br>
                          If your pet has severe reactions to loud sounds, you may consult your vet for any medication that might aid him during periods of distress, such as that is caused by fireworks and other loud sounds like thunderstorms.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Update your pet’s ID tag.</b><br>
                          Should your pet manage to escape, you need to make sure that he has proper identification tags for you to be able to track him just in case. If your pet isn’t microchipped, now would be a good time to take him to the vet to get one. Lost pets that have been microchipped are more likely to return home safely. You may also consider getting a GPS-activated collar for your pet if it’s something you can afford.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Leave your pet at home.</b><br>
                          It’s very important that your pets stay safely indoors during the holidays when there are fireworks involved. You might be tempted to take them to the park to see the fireworks and the parades, but this often isn’t a great idea. Your pet can easily get frightened and get lost in the crowd. Consider hiring a pet sitter or calling someone to pet-sit if you’re going out to turn your festival mode on.

                      <u> Canine parvovirus</u><br><br>
                      Canine parvovirus is a highly contagious virus that can affect all dogs, but unvaccinated dogs and puppies younger than four months old are the most at risk. Dogs that are ill from canine parvovirus infection are often said to have "parvo." The virus affects dogs' gastrointestinal tracts and is spread by direct dog-to-dog contact and contact with contaminated feces (stool), environments, or people. The virus can also contaminate kennel surfaces, food and water bowls, collars and leashes, and the hands and clothing of people who handle infected dogs. It is resistant to heat, cold, humidity, and drying, and can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Even trace amounts of feces from an infected dog may harbor the virus and infect other dogs that come into the infected environment. The virus is readily transmitted from place to place on the hair or feet of dogs or via contaminated cages, shoes, or other objects.<br><br>

                      <u> Signs of parvovirus </u><br><br>
                      Some of the signs of parvovirus include lethargy; loss of appetite; abdominal pain and bloating; fever or low body temperature (hypothermia); vomiting; and severe, often bloody, diarrhea. Persistent vomiting and diarrhea can cause rapid dehydration, and damage to the intestines and immune system can cause septic shock.<br><br>

                      <b><i>If your puppy or dog shows any of these signs, you should contact your veterinarian immediately.</i></b>

                     Purring is the most common sound cats make. Yet we know less about it than meowing, chirping, chattering, hissing, and growling.<br><br>
                      Yes, cats purr when they're content. When yours is curled up in the sun, you may hear a gentle rumble as they breathe in and out. Touch them, and you feel a little quiver. It's almost as if they are sending out waves of calm.<br><br>
                      But you shouldn't assume that sound means your cat is in a good mood. Or that it's the only time you'll hear it. Cats purr to communicate other emotions and needs, too.<br><br>
                      What if you pick your cat up and hold them? Do they purr because they like it -- or because they are nervous?<br><br>
                      Although you'll never know exactly what yours is saying when they purr, research from animal experts, along with considering the situation, lets you make an informed guess.<br><br>

                      As we humans escape into our homes that are air-conditioned or cooled with fans we wonder why our dogs might be acting sluggish or begging to get back inside. Have you ever noticed dogs who refuse to walk at an event and just plops himself down? Paws scorching on the Asphalt could be the problem… not your dog being stubborn.<br><br>

                      <b><i>The pads of a dogs feet are not any thicker than our feet so if it feels hot to your bare feet then it’s just as hot to your dog.</i></b><br><br>
                      Asphalt temperature and the outdoor temperature are two very different things. When the outside air temperature is 77 degrees the asphalt in the sun is 125 degrees. You can fry an egg at 131 degrees just imagine how your dog feels as you drag him along to the farmers market or outdoor festival being held on asphalt.<br><br>

                      <ol>

                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Pressing your own bare hands and feet on the pavement for at least 7-8 seconds is a recommended strategy to assess heat level.</b>

                      If you want to take an outing with your dog in the summer think water! Even non-water dogs still like to run along the edge and get their doggie tootsies wet and your feet will like it better too.

                      What Temperature Is Too Hot To Walk My Dog? There is not a hard and fast temperature that makes it too hot, but a good rule of thumb is 90 degrees and higher is too hot. On days with very high temperatures, the best idea is to modify your walk times to be early in the morning or late in the evening.<br>

                      <br>Signs of anxiety in cats to watch for – is your pet concerned?<br><br>

                      Cats are sensitive creatures! They like routine and don’t cope well with changes in their environment. It’s not always easy to spot if your cat is anxious or stressed, but it’s important to act fast if you are to limit any physical or emotional distress symptoms - you may start to see stress behaviors like spraying, scratching or hiding if your pet is unhappy!<br><br>

                      So, if you spot even small changes in your furry friend’s behavior, or if they seem to be acting out of character, try to find the reason - the sooner you get to the root of the problem, the sooner your cat will return to their usual self!<br><br>

                      <u> HOW TO SPOT SIGNS OF ANXIETY IN YOUR CAT</u><br><br>
                      If your cat has stopped eating, is behaving aggressively or spraying indoors, it could be a sign that they are stressed.<br><br>

                      If you are concerned about your cat, always check with your vet to rule out any illness that your feline friend may have contracted. Then, once you are sure that your pet has no physical condition, you can delve deeper into the cause of their anxiety.<br>

                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <b>Have you thought about their resources?</b>Cats don’t like their food and drink bowls close to their litter boxes! They’re clean animals and don’t like to use a litter box that has not been ‘refreshed’; they also like to have their own individual space to escape to, like a high perch, away from any other pets.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Have you moved home recently or had some building works done around the house? </b>Cats like familiarity so any major changes could unsettle them and make them feel anxious.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Have you brought home another pet? </b>It may take a while for your cat to accept that they’re not the only one who will get attention in your home. You may have to work at helping your cat and dog to get along a bit better.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          <b>Is there a new baby in the house?</b>New smells and sounds around a home that has been calm and peaceful till now, could be unnerving your cat.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>

                      Do our four-legged friends really see in black and white and what does it actually mean when they're wagging their tails? Do you think you know everything about your canine companion? Think again! Check out these surprising facts about dogs. <br><br>

                          <b>Dogs don’t feel Guilty</b><br>
                          Researchers found those puppy dog eyes are not a sign of guilt but fear. In fact it is just the way we interpret a dog’s reaction to being scolded. If they eat every biscuit in the house, they may look ashamed but don’t expect them to feel guilty as they don’t experience these emotions. Maybe Denver didn't eat the kitty-cat treats after all...

                          <b>Dogs can See in COLOR</b><br>
                          It is a common myth that dogs can only see in black and white. They only have two cones in their eyes to detect colors, whereas humans have three. That means dogs see colors on a blue and yellow scale but cannot distinguish between red and green. On the other hand, they have better night vision than humans. Their eyes take in information 25% faster than us, making them specially talented at catching a ball or frisbee.

                          We know dogs have a powerful sense of smell and while we can just about smell a spoonful of sugar in a cup of tea, our canine friends are capable of smelling that same spoonful in two Olympic swimming pools of water

                          <b>They can Smell Disease </b><br>
                          Research at the Schillerhohe Hospital in Germany found dogs have an incredible ability to recognize the smell of a range of organic compounds showing the human body isn’t working as it should. That means your dog can actually diagnose your cancer, something scientists are eager to explore further, as well as diabetes and the early signs of an epileptic seizure.

                          <b> Dogs can be Smart</b><br>
                          Dogs are as intelligent as a two year-old child, according to research presented to the American Psychological Association. Dogs can understand up to 250 words and gestures and even perform simple mathematical calculations. Perhaps unsurprisingly, border collies are the cleverest canines, with some able to understand up to 200 words. The other breeds in the top five are poodles, German shepherds, golden retrievers and dobermans.

                          <b>A Wagging Tail does NOT always mean they are Happy</b><br>
                          Tail wagging has its own language. Apparently dogs wag their tail to the right when they’re happy and to the left when they are frightened. Wagging low means they are insecure and rapid movements accompanied by tense muscles or dilated pupils can signal aggression. So every wagging tail tells its own story, if you know how to read the signs.

                          <b>They really are HOT Dogs</b><br>
                          Not only are dogs wearing a huge fur coat, they also have to contend with a higher body temperature than you. Human's have a body temperature of 37C, but a dog’s is 38C. That’s one reason fleas are more likely to be attracted to your dog than to you. And unlike humans, dogs don’t have sweat glands all over their body, just on the pads of their paws.

                          Apparently allowing your dog to wee on a lamp-post could be more dangerous than you think - because the acids in the urine can corrode the metal. In April 2003 Derbyshire County Council spent £75,000 carrying out a six month survey of one million lamp-posts amid fears that dog wee was causing the bases to crumple. In the same year, urinating dogs were blamed for a spate of lamp-posts collapsing in Croatia.

                          They are just as likely to turn into a green eyed monster as humans, according to scientists in California. Researchers studied 36 dogs from 14 breeds and found that most were indifferent when their owners ignored them until the owners showered their attention on a stuffed dog. Then their behavior changed dramatically, sparking snapping and snarling.

                      <u> Common reasons why your cat might be biting, chewing, or scratching itself.</u><br><br>
                      Most cats are meticulous groomers, but what happens when the behavior goes into overdrive? For a variety of reasons, some cat licking, scratching, and chewing behaviors become compulsive, which can annoy you and damage your pet’s skin and coat.<br><br>

                      If your cat is scratching, licking, or chewing themselves compulsively, it is likely you regularly catch them in the act. But if you don’t, your first clue may be the disappearance of your cat’s fur, often in strips along their back or stomach. Cats with self-mutilating behaviors may also cause red, irritated areas called hot spots to form, but they are less likely than dogs to do so.<br><br>

                      Although compulsive cat scratching, licking, or chewing behaviors can develop in any animal, they are more commonly observed in Siamese cats and other Oriental breeds. Female cats are more likely than males to lick, chew, or pull on their fur.<br><br>

                      Because there are a number of medical problems that may result in scratching and licking behaviors, be sure to consult with your veterinarian to help determine the cause and the best course of action.<br><br>

                      <u> Why Do Cats Compulsively Scratch, Lick, or Chew?</u><br><br>

                      <b>Parasites.</b>Parasites. Fleas are often the culprits behind compulsive cat scratching or cat licking behaviors. Because cats are excellent groomers, they may actually remove all traces of fleas. If you notice your cat licking their lower back obsessively, with or without scabs on the neck, it is a sign that fleas might be causing the problem. Other parasites, including ticks, mites, and ringworm, can also prompt scratching, licking, or chewing.<br><br>

                      <b>Allergies.</b> Just as some people develop skin irritations in response to certain foods or environmental triggers, cats may have itchy, irritated skin if they are allergic to something in their environment.<br><br>

                      <b>Dry skin.</b> Dry winter air or nutritional inadequacies can contribute to dry, flaky skin that gets your cat started licking or scratching in search of relief.<br><br>

                      <b>Pain.</b> If you notice your cat licking or biting at the same spot over and over again, it could be that they are experiencing pain or discomfort in that area.<br><br>

                      <b>Boredom, anxiety, or compulsive disorder.</b> Compulsive cat chewing, scratching, or licking behaviors often develop in cats who are bored, stressed, or anxious. These mental disorders are more likely to occur in indoor cats, which may be due to the fact that they receive less exercise and excitement than outdoor cats. Compulsive disorders often begin when there are changes in a cat’s environment, including a new animal or baby in the house or a move to a new location. Also, behaviors that started in response to a medical problem sometimes persist as compulsions after the condition is resolved.<br>
